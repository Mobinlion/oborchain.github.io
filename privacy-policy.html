      <h2>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
      <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our and our partners performing know-your-client services servers.  We do not intend to keep personal data any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed and used.</p>
      <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in particular, Israel, Canada and the United States.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure an adequate level of data protection and that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
